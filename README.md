## Overview
Welcome to my analysis of Data job Market, focusing on Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists roles. This project was created out of a desire to understand the Data job market better. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand to help find optimal job oppotunities for Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists. 

The data sourced from Luke Barousse which provides the foundation for my analysis. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

## The Questions

Below are the questions this project seeks to answer:

  1.What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?

2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn?

## Tools

The following are the tools used:

Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.
	
    - Pandas Library: The Pandas Library used to analyze the data.
	- Matplotlib Library: The library I used to visualize my Data.
	-Seaborn Library: The library I used to create advanced visuals.

Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my python scripts
Visual Studio Code: The tool for executing python scripts

Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration.

## Data Preparation and Data Cleaning

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

1. I imported the necessary Python libraries.
2. Loaded the dataset.
3. Initial Data Cleaning tasks to ensure Data quality.

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the US job market,  I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to job roles based in the United States


# The Analysis


## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular roles, first we filtered the three most popular data roles, and then extracted the top 5 skills for those top 3 roles.
This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills.
